Learned Form Validation through building a Calorie Counter.
This is guided project from freeCodeCamp, where I learned form validation by building a Calorie Counter. Please note that the code was 100% guided and I am able to find hints of the solutions in the forums. This project is quite far from my current level of JS knowledge.
